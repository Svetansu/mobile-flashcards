# Mobile Flashcards v1.0

This project is my first submission for the Mobile Flashcards react-native application, a project for the Udacity React Developer Nanodegree.

Mobile flashcards is is quiz-based application which allows users to test their knowledge about a particular field, or deck, in the app. The user can answer quizzes, create new ones, and retry a quiz if they're unhappy with their score.

The application was made in the Expo Snack environment. It was tested on the ios simulator available in Expo Snack.
